# Quick Poll
A very simple polling system to find a date and time that works for everyone.

## Description
The project prompts user to enter title. Upon submitting a sharable link to the poll instance is displayed below. After a submission is made to the poll the user will be shown all current submitors and their desired length for the event (if they filled this field) and a colored bar graph for everyday of the week. Each bar ranging from 12am to 12pm will have lines and rectangles representing time and time blocks chosen by submittors respectively.

I chose these technologies because they're the same technolgies I used on some of my previous projects and I am a strong believer in picking and sticking to a niche.
